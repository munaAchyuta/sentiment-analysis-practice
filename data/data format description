data format ::
There are three columns in the data: content, entity and sentiment. For the 'content', it is tokenized by space. For each token in the content, there are four columns seperated by '|': word, POS, word index position, distance to the nearest entity.
There is some data missing entity location. It is due to the difficulty in labeling the entity location. For these cases, distance to the nearest entity are all labeled '0'.
